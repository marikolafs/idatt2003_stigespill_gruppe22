## Features
- Players can choose from a set of predefined game variants: Multiple variants of Snakes and Ladders and Ludo.
- Supports 2-5 players.
- Each player selects a unique game piece/icon from a predefined set and names their character.
- The game uses two dice per turn, and the piece moves according to the sum of the roll.
- Different squares on the board trigger different actions (move up a ladder, fall down, etc.).
- The first player to reach square 90 (depending on the board variant) wins the game.
